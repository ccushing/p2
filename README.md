Submitted by Charles Cushing for CSCI E-15 : Dynamic Web Application. Spring 2016

2/14/2016

This project consists of a web form which allows a user to randomly generate passwords according to the rules set out in the XKCD comic. Words are randomly selected from a list of 50 words and concatenated together. The user has the option of adding dashes between the words, the number of words to use in the password (as long as it is between 3 and 9), the type case style to use (upper, lower, or mixed), and whether to append a symbol or number to the end of the password. The user is also allowed to generate between 1 and 20 passwords based on the criteria they have chosen.
